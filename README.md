# Judgment Topology v1.0

This repository defines a **minimal judgment topology** that prevents **undefined AI judgments** from transitioning into **execution**.

It introduces an explicit, finite-state boundary between probabilistic generation and permissioned action, without modifying models, prompts, or training procedures.

---

**This repository defines a structural boundary, not a policy recommendation or safety guideline.**
