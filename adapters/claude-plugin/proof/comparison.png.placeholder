# Comparison Screenshot Placeholder

This file is a placeholder for the actual side-by-side screenshot comparison.

## Expected Content

Two screenshots side by side:

### Left: Baseline (No Judgment Layer)
```
/triage-nda

→ Model: GREEN (92% confidence)
→ System: ✓ APPROVED for standard workflow
→ Next: Route to signing queue
```

### Right: With Judgment Layer
```
/triage-nda

→ Model: GREEN (92% confidence)
→ Judgment: ⚠️ HOLD
→ Reason: Classification ≠ approval authority
→ Required: Legal counsel review, authorized signatory
→ Evidence: decision.trace.jsonl
```

## How to Generate

1. Run the actual plugin in both configurations
2. Capture terminal output or UI screenshots
3. Place side-by-side comparison image here as `comparison.png`
4. Delete this placeholder file

## Visual Impact

This single image demonstrates:
- Same input
- Same model output
