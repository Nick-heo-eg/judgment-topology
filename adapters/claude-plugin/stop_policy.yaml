    decision: HOLD
    reason: >
      Legal classification is advisory output, not execution authority.
      Model assessment (GREEN/YELLOW/RED) provides information but does not
      constitute legal approval. Human review required before any binding action.

      - human_explicit_allow
      - decision_rationale

  - id: IRREVERSIBLE_COMMITMENT
    when:
      downstream_effect: irreversible
      legal_binding: true
    decision: STOP
    reason: >
      Irreversible legal commitment detected. Execution permanently blocked.
      Actions that create binding obligations must not proceed without
      explicit human authority outside the AI system.

  - id: NDA_APPROVAL_ATTEMPT
    when:
      command: triage-nda
      model_classification: GREEN
      implicit_approval: true
    decision: HOLD
    reason: >
      NDA classified as GREEN (low risk) by model. However, classification
      does not equal approval authority. Even low-risk NDAs require human
      judgment before signing or commitment.

      - legal_counsel_review
